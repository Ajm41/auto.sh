I wrote this Script for myself for my Recon, but then i thought as i learn from the community, so i should give back to community, to help beginner for starting in Infosec Community. 

I have just collected all the tool's that i found Best for doing the Recon Part of your Hunting. 
So that we can get some time to do some manual recon by our own.

I have listed the Name of the Owner of the Tools and their Twitter Handle.

I hope you all will find this useful in your Hunting. 

Any suggestions for me to do any upgrades in this tool is Highly Appreciated. (https://mobile.twitter.com/Broly157)
